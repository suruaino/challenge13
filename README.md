### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Always my first option before requesting help from anybody. Whenever i am confused, I always run to google. Its a good resource any coder.
- [Tailwind doc](https://www.tailwindcss/docs.com) - It is my most used resource. I only used others when a concept is confusing.
